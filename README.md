A tank game made in Unity

A basic tank game where it the player controls a tank and destroys targets within a tutorial area. 
It's main mechanics are 
- area specific damage
- bullet richotes
  
When a part of the tank is damaged this specific part will perform worse depdning on it's remaining health.
For example if the turret is damaged it will turn more slowly and stutter or if the engine is damaged it will
have less power. Bullet richotes give a percentage chance if a bullet will richocet or not. If a shell hits a 
surface at a low angle of attack this will give a higher chance that the shell will richocet. Other factors
like armour thickenss also effect this value where a higher thickess increases the richocet chance.
